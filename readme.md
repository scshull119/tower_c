# Tower C Railroad Simulator

Tower C Railroad Simulator (TCRS) is a proof-of-concept for a 3D railroad simulation platform written in C.
It is largely inspired by the vibrant community of "V-scale" modelers and operators that grew up around
[Microsoft Train Simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Train_Simulator) (MSTS)
in the early 2000's.  This community is capably served today by [Open Rails](https://www.openrails.org/), an open-source
successor to MSTS written in C#/.NET for the Windows platform. TCRS is born out of the desire for a comparable open-source
railroad simulator for Mac and Linux platforms. It is also intended to provide practical development 
experience with the C language, [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), and underlying graphics APIs such as OpenGL and Metal.

Some aspects of TCRS will be patterned after the outstanding work done by the Open Rails team, but TCRS is not 
intended to be an exact recreation of Open Rails, MSTS, or any other simulator.

**This project is in the very early development stages. It may take years to finish, or may never be finished at all.
It exists at this time solely for the education and enjoyment of its creators, and whoever else may be interested in
following its progress.**

### Why Tower C?

Tower C Railroad Simulator is named after Union Pacific's Tower C (20th St) in Omaha, NE: the westernmost of three
towers that controlled train movement through Omaha's Union Station from 1931 until 1969.  The name is also a
reference to the the C programming language used for development of this project.
